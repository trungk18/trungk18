### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Trung. I am a seasoned front-end engineer with 7 years of passion in creating experience-driven products. I am proficient in Angular, React and TypeScript development.

 I'm helping the Angular community by creating open sources and writing about interesting and useful topics. I found that there weren't many resources on building a proper real-world scale application, and that's my focus for sharing. My two most successful open-source projects are:

- [jira.trungk18.com](https://jira.trungk18.com)
- [tetris.trungk18.com](https://tetris.trungk18.com)

Recently, I organized [Angular Singapore](https://twitter.com/angularsg) to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Singapore. If you have any questions/problems with @angular or need any other advice? Book a FREE one-on-one meeting with me ðŸ‘‰ https://calendly.com/angular-singapore/15min

I'll try my best to help you. Thanks for visiting my Github :)
